# MeshRIR
MeshRIR is a dataset of acoustic room impulse responses (RIRs) at finely meshed grid points. Two subdatasets are currently available: one consists of IRs in a 3D cuboidal region from a single source, and the other consists of IRs in a 2D square region from an array of 32 sources. This dataset is suitable for evaluating sound field analysis and synthesis methods.

See the link below for the details.

### Usage
Extract the data files in the folder "src". For processing the IR data, see "ir_view.html" (converted from .ipynb) for Python or "ir_view.m" for Matlab. Example codes for sound field analysis and synthesis are included in the folder "example".
